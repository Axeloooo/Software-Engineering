An Azure subscription is a logical container used to provision resources in Azure. It holds details about the resources and includes information like billing and access control. Organizing resources into subscriptions helps manage and scale environments effectively.

## Azure Management Groups

</div>

Azure Management Groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions, allowing you to organize and manage multiple subscriptions efficiently. They facilitate the application of governance controls, such as policies and role-based access controls (RBAC), across subscriptions in a hierarchical manner. This structure enables centralized management and compliance enforcement, ensuring consistency across your Azure environment. Management Groups are particularly beneficial for large organizations that need to manage numerous subscriptions and resources systematically.

## Azure Policy

</div>

Azure Policy is a service that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that enforce rules and effects over your resources, ensuring they remain compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements. It allows for real-time policy evaluation and compliance assessment, providing insights into non-compliant resources and facilitating remediation. Azure Policy integrates with Azure Blueprints and Management Groups to apply policies across multiple subscriptions and resources efficiently.

## Azure Blueprints

</div>

Azure Blueprints enable you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implement and adhere to your organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Blueprints can include resources such as role assignments, policy assignments, Azure Resource Manager templates, and resource groups. They facilitate the deployment of compliant environments at scale, ensuring consistency and compliance across multiple subscriptions and environments. Azure Blueprints support versioning, allowing for iterative development and updates to your blueprints as organizational needs evolve.

## Azure Resource Groups

Resource Groups are containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. They enable management of resources collectively based on lifecycle and security requirements. Organizing resources into groups simplifies monitoring, access control, and provisioning.

## Azure Tags

Tags are name-value pairs that enable you to categorize resources for management tasks like billing or monitoring. Applying tags allows for organizing resources across resource groups and subscriptions, facilitating efficient management and reporting.
