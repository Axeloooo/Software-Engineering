## 1. Two Sum

- **LeetCode Link:** [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array, Hash Table

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
>
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
>
> You can return the answer in any order.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
> Output: [0,1]
> Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
> Output: [1,2]
> ```
>
> Example 3:
>
> ```txt
> Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
> Output: [0,1]
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

1. Create a hashmap (dictionary) to store the indices of the numbers in `nums`.
2. Iterate through the `nums` array:
   - For each number, calculate the complement (`target - nums[i]`).
   - Check if the complement exists in the hashmap:
     - If it does, return the current index and the index of the complement.
     - If it doesn't, add the current number and its index to the hashmap.
3. If no solution is found, return an empty list (though the problem guarantees a solution).

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        """
        Find indices of two numbers in nums that add up to target.

        Args:
            nums (List[int]): List of integers.
            target (int): Target sum.

        Returns:
            List[int]: Indices of the two numbers that add up to target.
        """
        h: Dict[int, int] = {}

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            h[nums[i]] = i

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            y: int = target - nums[i]

            if y in h and h[y] != i:
                return [i, h[y]]
```

## 202. Happy Number

- **LeetCode Link:** [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Hash Table, Math, Two Pointers

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.
>
> A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
>
> Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
> Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
> Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
> Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: n = 19
> Output: true
> Explanation:
> 12 + 92 = 82
> 82 + 22 = 68
> 62 + 82 = 100
> 12 + 02 + 02 = 1
> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: n = 2
> Output: false
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use a hashset to track seen numbers:

1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of numbers that have been seen.
2. Convert the number `n` to a string to easily access its digits.
3. While the current number is not in the seen set:
   - Add the current number to the seen set.
   - Calculate the sum of the squares of its digits.
   - If the sum equals 1, return `True`.
   - Update the current number to this new sum.
4. If the current number is already in the seen set, return `False` (indicating a cycle).

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        """
        Determine if a number n is a happy number.

        Args:
            n (int): The number to check.

        Returns:
            bool: True if n is a happy number, False otherwise.
        """
        seen: Set[str] = set()
        cur: str = str(n)

        while cur not in seen:
            seen.add(cur)
            summ: int = 0

            for digit in cur:
                digit = int(digit)
                summ += digit**2

            if summ == 1:
                return True

            cur = str(summ)

        return False
```

### ðŸ§® Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(log n)` because the number of digits in `n` decreases logarithmically as we sum the squares of its digits.
- Space Complexity: `O(log n)`

## 205. Isomorphic Strings

- **LeetCode Link:** [Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Hash Table, String

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.
>
> Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.
>
> All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation:
>
> The strings s and t can be made identical by:
>
> Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
> Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
>
> Output: false
>
> Explanation:
>
> The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.
> ```
>
> Example 3:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
>
> Output: true
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use hashmaps:

1. Create two hashmaps (dictionaries) to map characters from `s` to `t` and from `t` to `s`.
2. Iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously:
   - For each character pair `(c1, c2)` from `s` and `t`:
     - Check if `c1` is already mapped to a different character than `c2` or if `c2` is already mapped to a different character than `c1`.
     - If either condition is true, return `False`.
     - Otherwise, update the mappings for `c1` to `c2` and `c2` to `c1`.
3. If all character pairs are processed without conflicts, return `True`.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        """
        Check if two strings s and t are isomorphic.

        Args:
            s (str): First string.
            t (str): Second string.

        Returns:
            bool: True if s and t are isomorphic, False otherwise.
        """
        map_st: Dict[str, str] = {}
        map_ts: Dict[str, str] = {}

        for c1, c2 in zip(s, t):
            if (c1 in map_st and map_st[c1] != c2) or (
                c2 in map_ts and map_ts[c2] != c1
            ):
                return False

            map_st[c1] = c2
            map_ts[c2] = c1

        return True

## 242. Valid Anagram

- **LeetCode Link:** [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Hash Table, String, Sorting

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
>
> Output: true
> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
>
> Output: false`
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use hashmaps:

1. Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal. If not, return `False`.
2. Create two hashmaps (dictionaries) to count the occurrences of each character in `s` and `t`.
3. Iterate through the characters in both strings:
   - For each character in `s`, increment its count in `s_counter`.
   - For each character in `t`, increment its count in `t_counter`.
4. Compare the two hashmaps:
   - If they are equal, return `True`.
   - If they differ, return `False`.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        """
        Check if two strings s and t are anagrams of each other.

            t (str): Second string.

        Returns:

        t_counter: Dict[str, int] = {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            s_counter[s[i]] = 1 + s_counter.get(s[i], 0)
            t_counter[t[i]] = 1 + t_counter.get(t[i], 0)

        for c in s_counter:
            if s_counter[c] != t_counter.get(c, 0):
                return False

        return True

## 290. Word Pattern

- **LeetCode Link:** [Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Hash Table, String

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, find if `s` follows the same pattern.
>
> Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a non-empty word in `s`. Specifically:
>
> Each letter in `pattern` maps to exactly one unique word in `s`.
> Each unique word in `s` maps to exactly one letter in `pattern`.
> No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
>
> Output: true
>
> Explanation:
>
> The bijection can be established as:
>
> 'a' maps to "dog".
> 'b' maps to "cat".
> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
>
> Output: false
> ```
>
> Example 3:
>
> ```txt
> Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
>
> Output: false
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use hashmaps:

1. Split the string `s` into words.
2. Check if the length of `words` matches the length of `pattern`. If not, return `False`.
3. Create two hashmaps:
   - `map_pw`: Maps characters in `pattern` to words in `s`.
   - `map_wp`: Maps words in `s` to characters in `pattern`.
4. Iterate through the characters in `pattern` and the corresponding words in `s`:
   - For each character `c1` in `pattern` and word `c2`
     - Check if `c1` is already mapped to a different word than `c2` or if `c2` is already mapped to a different character than `c1`.
     - If either condition is true, return `False`.
     - Otherwise, update the mappings for `c1` to `c2` and `c2` to `c1`.
5. If all character-word pairs are processed without conflicts, return `True`.

        """
        words: List[str] = s.split()

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Hash Table, String, Counting

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.
>
> Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"

### ðŸ§© Approach

1. Use a hashmap (dictionary) to count the occurrences of each character in the `magazine`.
2. Iterate through each character in the `ransomNote`:
   - If the character is not in the hashmap, return `False`.
   - If the character's count is 1, remove it from the hashmap.
   - If the character's count is greater than 1, decrement its count in the hashmap.
3. If all characters in the `ransomNote` can be matched with those in the `magazine`, return `True`.
