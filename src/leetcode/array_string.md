## 13. Roman to Integer

- **LeetCode Link:** [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topic(s):** Hash Table, String, Math

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.
>
> ```txt
> Symbol Value
> I 1
> V 5
> X 10
> L 50
> C 100
> D 500
> M 1000
> ```
>
> For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.
>
> Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
>
> - `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
> - `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
> - `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.
>
> Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "III"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: III = 3.
> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "LVIII"
> Output: 58
> Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
> ```
>
> Example 3:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
> Output: 1994
> Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

1. Create a mapping of Roman numeral symbols to their integer values.
2. Initialize a result variable to `0`.
3. Iterate through the string:
   - If the current symbol is less than the next symbol, subtract its value from the result.
   - Otherwise, add its value to the result.
4. Return the result.

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topic(s):** Array, Two Pointers

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.
>
> Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
>
> - Change the array `nums` such that the first k elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
> - Return `k`.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: nums = [1,1,2]
> Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
> Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
> Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
> Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use the **two-pointer technique**:

- `i`: slow pointer, tracks the position of the last unique element.
- `j`: fast pointer, scans the array.

Steps:

1. Initialize `i = 0`.
2. Iterate `j` from 1 to end of array.
3. If `nums[j] != nums[i]`, itâ€™s a new unique element:
   - Increment `i`
   - Copy `nums[j]` to `nums[i]`
4. After the loop, the first `i + 1` elements are the unique values.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place and return the new length.

        Args:

        Returns:
            int: The new length of the array after removing duplicates.
        """
        i: int = 0

        for j in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                i += 1
                nums[i] = nums[j]

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` that are not equal to `val`.
>
> Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
>
> - Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of nums.

> Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
> Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
> Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
> Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use the **two-pointer technique**:

- One pointer (`i`) scans every element.
- Another pointer (`k`) keeps track of the position where the next valid (non-`val`) element should be placed.

Steps:

1. Iterate through the array.
2. If the current element is not equal to `val`, place it at index `k` and increment `k`.
3. After the loop, `k` will represent the new length of the array with `val` removed.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        """
        Remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place and return the new length.

        Args:
            nums (List[int]): The input array.
            val (int): The value to be removed.

        Returns:
            int: The new length of the array after removal.
        """
        k: int = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1
        return k

## 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

- **LeetCode Link:** [Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topic(s):** Two Pointers, String, String Matching

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
> The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
> Output: -1
> Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use a simple **sliding window** approach:

1. Iterate through `haystack` with a window of size equal to the length of `needle`.
2. For each position, check if the substring matches `needle`.
3. If a match is found, return the starting index.
4. If no match is found after checking all possible positions, return `-1`.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        """
        Find the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.

        Args:
            haystack (str): The string to search in.
            needle (str): The substring to search for.

        Returns:
            int: The index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if not found.
        """
        for i in range(len(haystack) + 1 - len(needle)):
            if haystack[i: i + len(needle)] == needle:

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
>
> A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "Hello World"

>
> Example 3:
>
> ```txt
> Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
> Output: 6
> Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

### ðŸ§© Approach

1. Split the string `s` into words using the `split()` method, which automatically handles multiple spaces.
2. Return the length of the last word in the list of words.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
>
> Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
>
> The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
> Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
> The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

> Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
> Output: [1]
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
> The result of the merge is [1].
> ```

> ```txt
> Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
> Output: [1]
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
> The result of the merge is [1].
> Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use three pointers:

- `midx` points to the last valid element in `nums1` (`m - 1`)
- `nidx` points to the last element in `nums2` (`n - 1`)
- `right` points to the last index in `nums1` (`m + n - 1`)

Compare elements from the back and place the larger one at index `right`. Decrement pointers accordingly.

Repeat until `nidx` reaches 0 (no need to worry about `midx`, since the rest are already in place).

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
from typing import List

            None: The result is stored in `nums1`.
        """
        midx: int = m - 1
        nidx: int = n - 1
        right: int = m + n - 1

        while nidx >= 0:
            if midx >= 0 and nums1[midx] > nums2[nidx]:
                nums1[right] = nums1[midx]

## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

- **LeetCode Link:** [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topic(s):** Array, Dynamic Programming

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.
>
> You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
>
> Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```txt
> Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
> Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
> ```
>
> Example 2:
>
> ```txt
> Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
> ```

### ðŸ§© Approach

Dynamic programming approach:

1. Initialize `profit` to `0` and `lowest` to the first price.
2. Iterate through the prices:

   - For each price, calculate the potential profit by subtracting `lowest` from the current price.
   - Update `profit` if the calculated profit is greater than the current `profit`.
   - Update `lowest` to be the minimum of the current price and `lowest`.

3. Return the `profit`.

This approach ensures that we always consider the lowest price seen so far, allowing us to calculate the maximum profit efficiently.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

### ðŸ§© Approach

Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:

1. Initialize a `count = 0` and `candidate = None`.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If `count == 0`, set `candidate = current element`
   - If `current element == candidate`, increment `count`
   - Else, decrement `count`
3. At the end, `candidate` is the majority element.

This works because the majority element appears more than all others combined.
