## 27. Remove Element

- **LeetCode Link:** [Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topic(s):** Array, Two Pointers

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` that are not equal to `val`.
>
> Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
>
> - Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of nums.
> - Return `k`.

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use the **two-pointer technique**:

- One pointer (`i`) scans every element.
- Another pointer (`k`) keeps track of the position where the next valid (non-`val`) element should be placed.

Steps:

1. Iterate through the array.
2. If the current element is not equal to `val`, place it at index `k` and increment `k`.
3. After the loop, `k` will represent the new length of the array with `val` removed.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
    """
    Remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place and return the new length.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): The input array.
        val (int): The value to be removed.

    Returns:
        int: The new length of the array after removal.
    """
    k: int = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != val:
            nums[k] = nums[i]
            k += 1
    return k
```

## 88. Merge Sorted Array

- **LeetCode Link:** [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topic(s):** Array, Two Pointers

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

> You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
>
> Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
>
> The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

### ðŸ§© Approach

Use three pointers:

- `midx` points to the last valid element in `nums1` (`m - 1`)
- `nidx` points to the last element in `nums2` (`n - 1`)
- `right` points to the last index in `nums1` (`m + n - 1`)

Compare elements from the back and place the larger one at index `right`. Decrement pointers accordingly.

Repeat until `nidx` reaches 0 (no need to worry about `midx`, since the rest are already in place).

### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```python
def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
    """
    Merge two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into `nums1` in-place.

    Args:
        nums1 (List[int]): The first sorted array with enough space to hold the elements of `nums2`.
        m (int): The number of elements in `nums1`.
        nums2 (List[int]): The second sorted array.
        n (int): The number of elements in `nums2`.

    Returns:
        None: The result is stored in `nums1`.
    """
    midx = m - 1
    nidx = n - 1
    right = m + n - 1

    while nidx >= 0:
        if midx >= 0 and nums1[midx] > nums2[nidx]:
            nums1[right] = nums1[midx]
            midx -= 1
        else:
            nums1[right] = nums2[nidx]
            nidx -= 1

        right -= 1
```
